- debugging and problem solving
- code reviews and explanations
- documentation writing

## GitHub Copilot

Integrated coding assistant with enterprise controls.

**Use for:**

- code completion and suggestions
- generating code from comments
- writing tests
- refactoring assistance

## Getting access

If you need access to these tools, [request a licence](/request-form).

## Privacy and security

Before using any AI tool, you must configure proper privacy settings. This keeps your sensitive information safe.

### 5. How to Use AI Effectively

**URL:** `/software-engineer/how-to-guide`  
**GDS Pattern:** Guide page with step-by-step content

#### Page Content

**Back link:** ‚Üê Software engineer guidance

**Breadcrumbs:** Home > Software engineer > How to use AI effectively

# How to use AI effectively in software development

Follow this guidance to get the most from AI tools while maintaining quality and security.

## Before you start

Make sure you have:

- access to approved AI tools
- configured privacy settings correctly
- read the acceptable use policy

## Getting started with AI-assisted development

### Write clear prompts

Be specific about what you want. Include context about your project, coding standards, and requirements.

**Good example:**
"Write a Python function to validate email addresses using regex. Follow PEP 8 style guide and include docstrings."

**Poor example:**
"Make an email validator."

### Start small

Begin with simple tasks like code explanations or basic functions before moving to complex features.

### Review everything

Always review and test AI-generated code. AI can make mistakes or suggest insecure practices.

## The Defra AI development workflow

Based on the [Defra AI SDLC playbook](https://defra.github.io/defra-ai-sdlc/), follow this workflow:

### 1. Project setup

- Define project requirements clearly
- Set up your development environment
- Configure AI tools with proper privacy settings

### 2. Development

Develop your solution iteratively, using AI for:

- implementation assistance
- code generation from specifications
- problem-solving and debugging

### 3. Test-driven development

Use AI tools to help with:

- writing test cases
- generating test data
- implementing tests alongside features

### 4. Testing

Apply AI for:

- unit testing strategies
- journey testing scenarios
- test automation

### 5. Refactoring

Once features are complete, use AI for:

- code optimisation suggestions
- improving readability
- identifying code smells

### 6. Documentation

Use AI to help:

- update technical documentation
- write clear code comments
- create user guidance
- maintain alignment with project goals

## Security and privacy considerations

### Protect sensitive information

- Never share personal data, API keys, or internal system details with AI tools
- Review your organisation's data classification before sharing any information
- Use dummy data for examples when possible

### Validate AI suggestions

- Don't trust AI-generated code blindly
- Test all code thoroughly
- Have peer reviews for AI-assisted work
- Check for security vulnerabilities

## Getting help

- [Browse the prompt library](/prompt-library) for examples from colleagues
- [Contact the AI Capabilities and Enablement team](/request-form) for support
- Join the #ask-ace Slack channel for questions

## Content Design Notes

**Following GDS content guidelines:**

- Front-loaded content (most important information first)
- Active voice and plain English
- Specific calls to action
- Progressive disclosure using details components
- Clear headings and subheadings
- Bulleted lists for scannable content
- Consistent terminology throughout
- Task-focused approach

**Technical considerations for future roles:**

- URLs include `/software-engineer/` to allow for other roles like `/policy-advisor/`, `/data-analyst/` etc.
- Generic pages (prompt library, request form, policy, survey) work for all roles
- Role switching preserves user context
- Content structure allows easy addition of new role-specific guidance

This structure provides a clear user journey while following GDS patterns and making it easy to extend for additional roles in future iterations.
